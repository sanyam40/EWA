--- Session Management --- 

A session is a conversational state between client and server and it can consist of multiple requests and responses between client and server. 
Since HTTP and Web Server both are stateless, the only way to maintain a session is when some unique information about the session (session-id) is passed between server 
and client in every request and response.
